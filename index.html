                        <p>The surname "Sitaula" is traditionally associated with the Khas ethnic group, which is one of the largest and historically significant groups in Nepal. The Khas people primarily inhabited the hilly regions of western Nepal and have had a profound influence on the country's history, language, and culture. The exact etymology of "Sitaula" is not definitively documented, but it is believed to have roots in the ancient socio-cultural practices of the Khas people.

                        <p>The Sitaula family, like other Khas families, would have traditionally adhered to Hindu customs and practices. The caste system, although less rigid among the Khas people compared to the plains of India, played a role in shaping social hierarchies. The Sitaula surname, like others, would have been associated with specific social and familial roles within the broader Khas community.</p>

                  <h3>What is the origin of the Sitaula surname?</h3>
                  <p>Sitaula (surname) Sitaula, or Sitoula, (Nepali: सिटाैला) is a Brahmin/Chhetri surname of Nepal. This surname was given to Shankar Padhya Bhardwaj's sons because they came from sitouli gaon of India. Shankar Padhya Bhardwaj entered Nepal during the time when non-Muslims were forcibly being converted from Hindus to Muslims.</p>

                  <h3>What is the gotra of Sitaula?</h3>
